  <b>Web Developer</b>

  <p>When I came on board, the production sites were written in PHP without the use of a framework; 
    SQL queries were interspersed in the code; there was no testing of any kind, updates to 
    production sites were done via FTP upload, and people were using Dreamweaver to code. 
    In the course of my employment, I brought over significant changes to the process of 
    web development & maintenance. I was instrumental in rewriting the most-visited site 
    (<a href="http://clomedia.com">http://clomedia.com</a>) into a modern MVC pattern, 
    using industry-wide standards such as TDD, agile methodology, and ORM.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advised the team on the use of technology</li>
    <li>Suggested and implemented the use of an MVC (CakePHP)</li>
    <li>Suggested and implemented iterative development and test-driven development</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Additionally, used the following languages to parform/automate tasks:
    <b>Python, Java, bash, sch, PHP</b></p>
